                  <strong>No Rights Upon Termination.</strong> Upon termination
                  and regardless of the reason(s) motivating such termination,
                  your right to log into your account on this Site will
                  immediately cease. We shall not be liable to you or any third
                  party for any claims for damages arising out of any
                  termination or suspension or any other actions taken by us in
                  connection therewith. Your liability for any unpaid fees for
                  any of our products, shall survive any termination. You
                  understand that if you choose to terminate your account, you
                  shall not be entitled to a refund of any unused bids. In the
                  event that We initiate a termination of your account, Our
                  liability for any damages that you incur as a result of such
                  termination shall be restricted to the cost of any unused Real
                  Bids in your account as of the date and time of the
                  termination. Any such refunds shall be subject to our Refund
                  Policy. If your account is suspended or terminated following a
                  finding of fraudulent or illegal activity or because you
                  created multiple accounts, you understand and agree that any
                  auctions that were won by you through the account that was
                  involved in the fraudulent or illegal activity or through the
                  account that was an additional account created by you, shall
                  be automatically forfeited. The auction(s) shall be deemed to
                  have been won by the first runner-up and you shall not be
                  entitled to a refund of any Bids that were used in any
                  auctions that gave rise to the suspension or termination.

                  GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTES
                </h3>
                <p>
                  This Site is controlled by Us from our offices in Lagos,
                  Nigeria and the statutes and laws of Lagos State as well as
                  the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria where applicable,
                  shall be controlling, without regard to the conflicts of laws
                  principles thereof. You agree and hereby submit to the
                  exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of any court of
                  competent jurisdiction in Lagos State with respect to such
                  matters controlled by that court.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You and Kobobid each agree that, except as otherwise noted
                  below, any dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any
                  way to these Terms, or to any products or services sold,
                  including, but not limited to, the advertising of or sales
                  practices relating to such products and services, delivery and
                  any communication, by whatever means, between you and Kobobid,
                  which cannot be settled, by mutual agreement/negotiation
                  within 1 (one) month will be resolved by binding, individual
                  arbitration, rather than in court. Disputes and claims that
                  are within the scope of a Magistrate court’s authority are
                  exempt from this dispute resolution provision, so long as they
                  are brought individually and not as a class action.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The venue for the arbitration shall be the Lagos Multi-Door
                  Courthouse (“LMDC”) and the proceedings shall be governed by
                  the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, Cap A10, Laws of the
                  Federation of Nigeria, 2004. You and Kobobid shall appoint the
                  Arbitrator and where both parties are unable to agree on the
                  choice of an Arbitrator, the choice of an Arbitrator shall be
                  referred to the LMDC. The findings of the Arbitrator and
                  subsequent award shall be binding on both parties and both
                  parties shall bear their respective costs in connection with
                  the Arbitration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU AND KOBOBID UNDERSTAND THAT
                  EACH IS AGREEING TO WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO SUE OR GO TO COURT TO
                  ASSERT OR DEFEND ITS RIGHTS UNDER THIS CONTRACT. THE RULES IN
                  ARBITRATION ARE DIFFERENT. THERE IS AN ARBITRATOR, NOT A
                  JUDGE. ALTHOUGH REVIEW IS LIMITED, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON
                  AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS WOULD BE
                  AVAILABLE IN COURT, AND MUST ENFORCE THE SAME LIMITATIONS
                  STATED IN THESE TERMS AS A COURT WOULD.

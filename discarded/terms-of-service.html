              You can only send Real Bids with the Bids Transfer feature; Token

              <b>Option to Purchase.</b> Products that have the “Buy It Now”
              feature are available for auction and/or outright purchase on the
              Site. If you do not win the bid on a product that has the “Buy It
              Now” feature, you may choose to apply your used bids towards the
              purchase of that product within 24 hours from the end of that
              auction. Only Real Bids that have already been used in an auction
              can be applied towards a purchase and the used Real Bids can only
              be applied towards the purchase of the same product that resulted
              in a lost auction.

              <b>BidMate.</b> You may use our automated bidding tool called
              ‘BidMate’. BidMate is a tool that assists you in bidding in your
              auction of choice while You are online or offline. You may
              activate or deactivate BidMate at any time, and multiple BidMates
              may simultaneously be activated across various ongoing auctions on
              the Site. Real Bids and Token Bids can be used by the BidMate tool
              and your Bids will be used in the order in which they were bought,
              from the oldest to the newest. Note that if the item you’re
              bidding on only allows Real Bids, your BidMate will follow suit.
              Once activated, BidMate will be able to use up to 30 bids to bid
              on your behalf and will bid according to the specifications which
              you have set.
            </p>
            <p>
              Activating BidMate does not guarantee participation in an auction
              and We do not guarantee the precision or effectiveness of the
              BidMate tool. Kobobid will therefore not be liable for any errors
              or delays that occur while using the BidMate tool.

              to make the payment within the 48-hour timeframe will be
              considered a forfeiture of the auction win. Once a forfeiture
              occurs, the next runner-up bidder will be offered the item. The
              runner-up bidder will also have 48 hours from the time of

              the associated shipping and handling charges, in order to redeem

              restricted to the cost of any unused Real Bids in your account as

              that any auctions that were won by you through the account that
              was involved in the fraudulent or illegal activity or through the

              refund of any Bids that were used in any auctions that gave rise

              This Site is controlled by Us from our offices in Lagos, Nigeria
              and the statutes and laws of Lagos State as well as the laws of
              the Federal Republic of Nigeria where applicable, shall be
              controlling, without regard to the conflicts of laws principles
              thereof. You agree and hereby submit to the exclusive personal
              jurisdiction and venue of any court of competent jurisdiction in
              Lagos State with respect to such matters controlled by that court.
            </p>
            <p>
              You and Kobobid each agree that, except as otherwise noted below,
              any dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way to
              these Terms, or to any products or services sold, including, but
              not limited to, the advertising of or sales practices relating to
              such products and services, delivery and any communication, by
              whatever means, between you and Kobobid, which cannot be settled,
              by mutual agreement/negotiation within 1 (one) month will be
              resolved by binding, individual arbitration, rather than in court.
              Disputes and claims that are within the scope of a Magistrate
              court’s authority are exempt from this dispute resolution
              provision, so long as they are brought individually and not as a
              class action.
            </p>
            <p>
              The venue for the arbitration shall be the Lagos Multi-Door
              Courthouse (“LMDC”) and the proceedings shall be governed by the
              Arbitration and Conciliation Act, Cap A10, Laws of the Federation
              of Nigeria, 2004. You and Kobobid shall appoint the Arbitrator and
              where both parties are unable to agree on the choice of an
              Arbitrator, the choice of an Arbitrator shall be referred to the
              LMDC. The findings of the Arbitrator and subsequent award shall be
              binding on both parties and both parties shall bear their
              respective costs in connection with the Arbitration.
            </p>
            <p>
              BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU AND KOBOBID UNDERSTAND THAT EACH
              IS AGREEING TO WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO SUE OR GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR
              DEFEND ITS RIGHTS UNDER THIS CONTRACT. THE RULES IN ARBITRATION
              ARE DIFFERENT. THERE IS AN ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE. ALTHOUGH
              REVIEW IS LIMITED, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS
              THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN COURT, AND
              MUST ENFORCE THE SAME LIMITATIONS STATED IN THESE TERMS AS A COURT
              WOULD.

              with this Site is in conflict or inconsistent with these Terms,

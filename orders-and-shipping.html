              <h4>ORDERS & SHIPPING</h4>
              <h6>When will my item be shipped?</h6>
              <p>
                Although delivery times vary based on your location and the item
                that was auctioned, we typically ship orders within 3 business
                days after the item has been paid for. During high volume
                periods and the rainy season, your order could be delayed by
                additional days.
              </p>
              <h6>Tracking Information</h6>
              <p>
                After your item is shipped, we will provide you with tracking
                information via email. Please check your email for updates on
                your order and use the tracking number provided to monitor the
                progress of the shipment and delivery.
              </p>
              <h6>Where’s My Item?</h6>
              <p>
                We work as quickly as we can to process your order. If you’re
                wondering why you haven’t received your item, please use the
                tracking number that was sent to you. Depending on your
                location, please allow up to 14 days for your order to arrive.
                If you think your order should have arrived but you haven’t
                received it, please track your order using the tracking number
                that was provided to you at the time of shipping. If you can’t
                view, track or determine the status of your order, you may
                contact our Customer Service department <a href="#">here</a>.
              </p>
              <h6>Items that are lost, stolen or damaged in transit</h6>
              <p>
                While we have the utmost trust in our shipping partners, we
                recognise that in rare cases, an item that has been sent to you
                may be damaged during transit, lost or stolen. Unfortunately,
                once an item is shipped to you, the risk of loss or damage
                shifts away from us to you and Kobobid will not be responsible
                for any damaged, stolen or lost items.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once notified of your shipment, please use the tracking number
                that was provided to you to track and monitor the progress of
                the shipment. Being aware of your expected delivery date might
                help to mitigate the risk of loss.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any claims for damage that occurred while in transit, loss or
                theft must be made to our shipping partner. If you experience
                any issues of damage, loss or theft, please contact us. Our
                Customer Service and Logistics teams will do their best to
                assist you with any relevant documentation that may be required
                to file a claim with our shipping partner.

              <h4>SAFETY MEASURES</h4>
              <p>
                All our personnel take protective and hygiene measures to
                deliver your items safely to you, in line with health advice
                provided by global health agencies in response to the
                Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic. Because we take these safety
                measures seriously, we have chosen FedEx as our shipping partner
                based on their impressive commitment to keep their customers
                safe during the pandemic. To read more about how FedEx is
                responding to the pandemic, you may visit their site

              <h4>RETURNS</h4>
              <h6>Quality Assurance</h6>
              <p>
                We stand behind the quality of the products we offer and want
                every auction to be a positive experience. If by any chance, the
                product you received is defective, we will do our best to make
                it right.
              </p>
              <h6>Is there a limitation on initiating a return?</h6>
              <p>
                We allow returns and exchanges for certain products within 14
                days of the delivery date. If no tracking number was assigned at
                the time of shipping, the item to be returned must be received
                within 21 days of the shipping date. The eligibility for return
                will depend on the circumstances and reason for return.
              </p>
              <h6>I received a defective product</h6>
              <p>
                All of our products are tested and inspected before shipment. If
                you however, receive a defective product, please
                <a href="#">contact</a> our customer care team. Defective
                products that are eligible for return may be returned for either
                a refund or an exchange.
              </p>
              <h6>The wrong item was sent to me</h6>
              <p>
                If by some error, we send you the wrong item, colour, size or
                specification of the product you ordered, the item would be
                eligible for a refund or exchange.
              </p>
              <h6>How do I send my item that is eligible for a return?</h6>
              <p>
                If your item is eligible for a return, we will either send you a
                prepaid shipping label or instructions to drop it off at our
                facility. Any items being returned to us must be in its original
                packaging and in new or unused condition. It must also include
                all parts, accompanying literature (manuals, packaging leaflets,
                instructions, warranty cards, promotional coupons etc.) and
                accessories (batteries, chargers, cords, attachments,
                extensions, etc.).
              </p>
              <h6>What happens after Kobobid receives my returned item?</h6>
              <p>
                We inspect all returned items to ensure that it is the exact
                same item that was sent to you and that the item has been
                returned to us in its original condition. The returned item’s
                UPC or serial number must match the number we have in our
                records. Removal or alteration of the product’s UPC or serial
                number label will automatically void any possibility of refund
                or exchange. After inspection, if we discover that (a) the
                numbers are mismatched; or (b) the number has been altered or
                removed; or (c) the item appears to have been used; or (d) the
                item’s packaging has been damaged; or (e) some of the item’s
                parts, literature, accessories or other like accompanying
                materials is missing, we will void the eligibility for return or
                refund and return the item to you. If we sent you a shipping
                label, we will send you an invoice for the refund of the cost of
                returning the item to us. You will also be responsible for the
                cost of sending the item back to you.

              <h4>EXCHANGE & REFUNDS</h4>
              <p>
                Defective or wrong items may be exchanged/replaced at no
                additional cost to you. If you choose to receive a refund, only
                the Final Auction Price paid at checkout will be refunded.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, we are unable to refund the shipping fee that was
                paid to ship the item to you. If your item is eligible for a
                return because it is defective or because we sent you the wrong
                item, we will bear the cost of receiving back the item from you
                and if you desire, sending you a replacement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your refund will be applied to the original form of payment. We
                are unable to make refunds to an alternative account. Refunds
                will be processed after we receive and inspect your returned
                item. Please allow up to 10 business days to receive your
                refund. For the avoidance of doubt, please note that bids placed
                in auctions are not eligible for refunds.

                Once we process your order, it is no longer eligible for

              <h6>When we’re unable to fulfil your order</h6>

                alternative but comparable item. If you decline the alternative
                item, you will receive a full refund of the transaction amount
                including all shipping and payment processing charges. In
                addition, any bids used in that specific auction will be
                credited back to your account. For the avoidance of doubt, we
                are unable to refund the cost of the bids purchased and used in

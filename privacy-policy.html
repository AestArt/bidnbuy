          <p>
            In order to better provide you with our services, we collect various
            types of information about our users identified below.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</b> This refers to
            information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you
            engage in certain activities on this Site, such as register for an
            account, purchase a bid pack, bid for a product or service, post
            content in the user forums, sign up for our newsletters or email
            lists, or send us feedback, we, or our third-party payment processor
            may ask you to provide certain information about yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples of PII may include your first and last name, email address,
            mailing address, billing address, telephone numbers, Bank
            Verification Number (BVN) and other identifying information.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Aggregate Information.</b> This refers to information that does
            not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain
            information about you based upon where you visit on our Site and
            what other sites may have directed you to us. This information,
            which is collected in a variety of different ways, is compiled and
            analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This
            information may include the Website’s Uniform Resource Locator
            (“URL”) that points to the site you just came from, which URL you go
            to after visiting our Site, what browser you are using, and your

          <h4>2. How We Collect and Use Information</h4>
          <p>
            We do not collect any PII about you unless you voluntarily provide
            it to us. However, you will be required to provide certain PII to us
            when you elect to use certain products or services available on the
            Site. These may include:
          </p>
          <ol id="l-alpha">
            <li>registering for an account on our Site</li>
            <li>purchasing bid packs on our Site</li>
            <li>
              entering a sweepstakes or contest sponsored by us or one of our
              partners
            </li>
            <li>signing up for special offers from selected third parties</li>
            <li>
              sending us an email message or contacting us through other
              electronic means available through our Site
            </li>
            <li>
              submitting a form or transmitting other information by telephone
              or letter; or
            </li>
            <li>ordering and purchasing products and services on our Site.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            When processing certain information, such as payment information
            with affiliated banking institutions or payment processors, we
            encrypt the transaction, using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption
            technology, in order to prevent your information from being stolen
            or intercepted. Additionally, your debit card information is never
            stored on our servers, but is tokenized and sent directly to the
            appropriate financial gateways.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will primarily use your PII to provide product or service
            offerings to you. We will also use certain forms of PII to enhance
            the operation of our Site, improve our internal marketing and
            promotional efforts, statistically analyze Site use, improve our
            product and service offerings, and customize our Site’s content,
            layout, and services. We may use PII to deliver information to you
            and to contact you regarding administrative notices. Finally, we may
            use your PII to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce
            our agreements with you, including our Site
            <a href="./terms-of-service.html">Terms of Use</a>, and this Privacy
            Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also collect, or our third party advertising partners may
            collect, certain Aggregate Information. For example, we may use your
            IP address to diagnose problems with our servers or software, to
            administer our Site and to gather demographic information. Our third
            party advertising partners may also provide us with aggregate, but
            not individual, reports that will tell us how many ads were
            presented and clicked upon at our Site, or certain behavioural
            patterns that occur when browsing through our Site.

          <h4>3. Cookies</h4>
          <p>
            Depending on how you use our Site, we will store cookies on your
            computer in order to collect certain aggregate data about our users
            and to customize certain aspects of your specific user experience. A
            cookie is a small data text file which is stored on your computer
            that uniquely identifies your browser. Cookies may also include more
            personalized information, such as your IP address, browser type, the
            server your computer is logged onto, the area code and postal code
            associated with your server, and your first name to welcome you back
            to our Site. We may use cookies to perform tasks such as: monitoring
            aggregate site usage metrics, storing and remembering your passwords
            (if you allow us to do so), storing account and advertising
            preferences that you have set, and personalizing the Services we
            make available to you. However, we do not use cookies to track your
            browsing behaviors.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also use an outside advertising partner to display banner
            advertisements on our Site. As part of their service, they will
            place a separate cookie on your computer. We will not provide any
            third-party advertising partners with any of your PII or information
            about your purchases or activities on the Site. We and our third
            party ad server will collect and use Aggregate Information about
            you, such as your IP address, browser type, the server your computer
            is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with your
            server and whether you responded to a particular ad. Other
            advertisers may also place banner ads on our Site in the same manner
            as above, but we will not disclose any PII to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can
            reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a
            cookie is being sent. However, some aspects of the Site may not
            function properly if you elect to disable cookies.

        <div class="my-4">
          <h4>4. Release of Information</h4>
          <p>
            We will not sell, trade, or rent your PII to others. We do provide
            some of our services and products being auctioned through
            contractual arrangements made with affiliates, service providers,
            partners and other third parties (“Service Partners”). We and our
            Service Partners may need to use some PII in order to perform tasks
            between our respective sites, or to deliver products or services to
            you. For example, our payment processor must collect your billing
            information; we must release your address information to the
            delivery service to deliver products that you’ve successfully bid
            for; and provide your order information to any third parties that
            help us provide customer service.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will encourage our Service Partners to adopt and promote strong
            privacy policies. However, the use of your PII by our Service
            Partners is governed by the respective privacy policies of those
            providers, and is not subject to our control. Except as otherwise
            discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the
            use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other Sites
            accessible through this Site, including our Advertising and Service
            Partners, have their own privacy policies and data collection, use
            and disclosure practices. Please consult each Site’s privacy policy.
            We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third
            parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Occasionally, we may be required by law enforcement or judicial
            authorities to provide PII to the appropriate governmental
            authorities. In such cases, we will disclose PII upon receipt of a
            court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement
            investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in
            identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We
            reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any
            activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also provide Aggregate Information about our customers’
            sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to third party
            advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally
            Identifiable Information.

          <h4>5. Updating and Correcting Information</h4>

            We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the PII
            that you have provided to us. You may change any of your PII in your
            account online at any time by . You may also access and correct your

          <p>Please include your name and email address when you contact us.</p>
          <p>
            We encourage you to promptly update your PII if it changes. You may
            delete your information or ask to have the information on your
            account deleted or removed; however, some information, such as past
            transactions, logs of technical support calls, or other information
            may not be deleted. In addition, it may be impossible to completely
            delete your information without some residual information because of
            backups.

          <h4>6. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</h4>
          <p>
            We may, from time to time, send you email regarding new products and
            services that we feel may interest you. In addition, if you
            indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving
            offers or information from us and our partners, we may occasionally
            call or send you direct mail about products and services that may be
            of interest to you. Only Kobobid (or agents working on behalf of
            Kobobid and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these
            solicitations, and only if you have previously indicated that you
            wish to receive them. If you do not want to receive solicitations
            from us, you can “opt-out” by accessing your account online editing
            your account information to no longer receive such offers and
            mailings.

          <h4>7. Security of Your PII</h4>
          <p>
            On our Site, you can be assured that your PII is secure, consistent
            with current industry standards. We strive to take appropriate
            security measures to protect against unauthorized access,
            unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of your PII. For
            example:
          </p>
          <ol id="l-alpha">
            <li>
              We work hard to ensure that the data we collect is reliable,
              accurate, complete and current. We encrypt all PII, in order to
              prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it
              is transmitted to us. We also only keep collected information only
              for as long as reasonably necessary and use it only for the
              purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any
              applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention
              requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              We limit access to PII only to specific employees, contractors and
              agents who have a reasonable need to come into contact with your
              information. For example, we may provide members of our technical
              support team with limited access to your account in order to allow
              them to troubleshoot problems you may be having with the Site.
            </li>
            <li>
              Additionally, we also employ a number of physical, electronic, and
              procedural safeguards to protect PII. Our secure servers and our
              data centers are protected by industry-standard encryption, and
              our servers reside behind firewalls and employ high-level password
              protection.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, access by you to your PII is available through a password
              and unique customer ID selected by you. This password is
              encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to
              anyone.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            In order to most effectively serve you, debit card transactions are
            handled by established third party banking institutions and payment
            processors. They receive the information needed to verify and
            authorize your debit card or other payment information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any
            wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result,
            while we strive to protect your PII, you acknowledge that: (a) there
            are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which
            are beyond our control; and (b) the security, integrity and privacy
            of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us
            through this Site cannot be guaranteed.

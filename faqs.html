              <h6>What is a bid?</h6>
              <div>
                A bid is the price that you are willing to pay to participate in
                any of our auctions. On Kobobid, a bid represents 1 kobo.
              </div>
              <h6>How much is a bid worth?</h6>
              <div>
                1 bid = 100 naira. Visit our “What is a BidPack?” page to
                <a href="what-is-bidpack.html">learn more.</a>
              </div>
              <h6>How long do I have until a bid is over?</h6>
              <div>
                You have 10 seconds to bid for each item up for auction. Once
                the clock reaches 00:00:00 under any item, bidding is over for
                that item, except in the case of

              </div>
              <h6>How long do I have to wait to bid again?</h6>
              <div>
                No time at all. There are always fantastic items up for auctions
                on kobobid.com, so you can bid on multiple items at a time and
                whenever. You simply need to ensure your BidPack is stacked and
                ready.
              </div>
              <h6>How do I bid on an auction?</h6>

              <h6>What is a BidPack?</h6>
              <div>
                A BidPack is basically your bidding power on Kobobid. You’ll
                need to
                <a href="#">purchase a BidPack</a> before you can begin to place
                bids on your favourite items.
              </div>
              <h6>How many BidPacks can I purchase at once?</h6>
              <div>
                You can purchase as many BidPacks as you want. It’s really up to
                you.
              </div>
              <h6>How long are my bids valid for after purchase?</h6>
              <div>
                Your Real Bids are valid for 60 days after purchase after which
                they convert to token bids. Token bids are valid for 30 days.

              <h6>Can I bid with third party tools or software?</h6>
              <div>
                Erm… No. Third party tools and software such as bidding bots are
                strictly prohibited on kobobid.com, and to use them would place
                you in violation of our
                <a href="terms-of-service.html">Terms and Conditions</a> which
                could lead to you being blocked from our platform and/or face

                Yes, there are. Please see the Auction Limits section in our

              <h6>
                What is the difference between a real bid and a token bid?
              </h6>
              <div>
                Real Bids are bids you get when you purchase a BidPack, while
                token bids are those you win in auctions, bonuses that come with
                your BidPack purchases, or bids received through a promotion we
                or an affiliate of ours is running. Check out the full breakdown
                for Real Bids vs Token Bids

              <h6>How do I claim my win?</h6>
              <div>
                Just follow the payment prompts on the auction page or in your
                notifications.
              </div>
              <h6>How long do I have after winning to claim my win?</h6>
              <div>
                We would imagine you wouldn’t want to waste a moment to claim
                your win. However, after winning your auction, you will have
                48hrs to pay the final Auction Price + Shipping &amp; Handling
                (where applicable). If you fail to redeem your winnings within
                this time, the item won will automatically go to the runner up
                from that auction to claim.

                No, you should not. Each user is entitled to one account only.
                Doing otherwise would be in violation of our
                <a href="terms-of-service.html">Terms and Conditions</a>. If we
                suspect such an activity on your part, your account would be
                blocked permanently, your bids will be invalidated, and you will
                be banned from using our platform.

                With Kobobid, it’s not too good to be true. You can get the BEST
                products as sold in any store, anywhere for way less than their

                happens on your terms. You simply have to outbid others who want
                it just as much as you do.

              <h6>What is a kobo auction?</h6>
              <div>
                A kobo auction is our take on the popular “penny auctions''
                found in other parts of the world. On Kobobid, any bid placed on
                an item increases the price of the item by just ONE Kobo. When
                the auction ends and a winner emerges, the winner pays the final
                price of the item which is the accumulated figure of all the
                kobo bids placed on said item at the time. For more information
                on kobo auctions, please visit our
                <a href="auction.html">Kobo Auctions</a> page.
              </div>
              <h6>Who can participate in kobo auctions?</h6>
              <div>
                Anyone 18 years or older can join kobobid.com and take part in
                kobo auctions.
              </div>
              <h6>Are kobo auctions legal?</h6>
              <div>
                They certainly are. Kobo auctions – like penny auctions – have a
                huge following in different parts of the world. At Kobobid, we
                have met the legal requirements provided by the Certified
                Institute of Auctioneers, Nigerian and the National Lottery
                board, so there’s no mago-mago over here.

              <div>
                All is not lost, if you don’t win a kobo auction, you can still

                Are Kobobid employees also allowed to take part in kobo
                auctions?
              </h6>
              <div>
                No, they’re not. Kobobid employees - and even other persons
                engaged or associated with the brand directly or indirectly - do
                not get to join in this particular fun. We engage ourselves in

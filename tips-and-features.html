              <h6>Here’s the gist:</h6>

              </ul>

                N5000 and above! In conclusion, go and buy your first BidPack, if you haven’t

                <h5 id="BidMate">BidMate</h5>
                <p>
                  You can’t always be on your device when auctions go live. We get it, we all need
                  our beauty sleep. Yet, you need to stay alert to stay ahead. In short, you need a
                  BidMate. It’s basically your personal assistant on our platform, making sure you
                  have eyes everywhere and are always ready for action. So, here are some things you
                  need to know about your BidMate:
                </p>
                <ul id='l-nav'>
                  <li>
                    You can activate your BidMate before or during auctions to help you bid
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You can choose to do so before an auction goes live. So long as an auction is
                    live on the site, you can #SetItandForgetIt
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You can activate your BidMate during an auction, also while simultaneously
                    bidding manually because why? Teamwork makes the dream work!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    More BidMates = better chances. Take advantage of multiple BidMates to help you
                    bid on multiple auctions (at the same darn time!) and increase your chances of
                    winning.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Each BidMate activation allows a maximum of 30bids to be set at one time
                  </li>
                  <li>You can cancel your BidMate activation at any time</li>
                  <li>
                    Let your BidMate help you manage your bids – you get an alert once your BidMate
                    goes down to the final 5 bids in your BidPack. This helps you decide if you want
                    to continue to bid on the item in question or not.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Other things to know about your BidMate:</h6>
                <ul id='l-nav'>
                  <li>
                    Your BidMate automatically bids on the item selected once the auction time drops
                    anywhere below the 10sec mark. This means it could auto bid sometimes at the
                    10secs mark, 7secs mark, 1sec mark and so on and so forth. Its algorithm is
                    completely random.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Your BidMate will use up your Real Bids first before Token Bids. Your Bids will
                    be used in order of date purchased. See Real Bids vs Token Bids for more.

                  and miss these auctions -- they have only a 5 or 7 seconds countdown clock --
                  meaning you have to be even quicker to try to win these auctions. To make the most
                  out of Flash Auctions:

                      Additionally, some auctions will turn into Flash Auctions while they’re live!
                      That’s why you always gotta #StayWoke and turn on your BidMate
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                  Bidding is fun. But, you – or your BidMate – may not always have to get into a
                  bidding war. You can decide to buy your item of choice outright. Just do the
                  following:
                </p>
                <ul id='l-nav'>
                  <li>
                    Place at least ONE real bid on the item.The value of Real Bids on that
                    particular auction item will be applied towards the exact item/product in the
                    Buy It Now section.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You’ll have 24hrs to take advantage of the Buy It Now option after bidding on
                    the item ends, BUT...
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Be sure to follow the auction closely -- your notifications are your best
                    friend. There are only a limited number of items available for the Buy It Now
                    option, so make sure you pay attention before someone else scoops up your item
                    right in front of your eyes.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The Buy It Now option also unlocks another level of discounts on items on auction.
                  To take advantage of the Buy It Now option, note that:
                </p>
                <ul id='l-nav'>
                  <li>
                    You cannot choose the Buy It Now option for an item you’ve just won. You already
                    won it. Just go ahead and claim your win. Give the runners up a chance.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Not all items are available to ‘Buy It Now’, especially items like Cash,
                    Airtime, Data and BidPacks.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Psst! Sometimes when we’re feeling generous, we’ll even throw in some surprise
                    extra discounts, so you end up paying much less than retail for your Buy It Now
                    item.

                  There might be a tie between Watchlist and BidMate for who your best friend is on
                  Kobobid.com. We’ll let you decide. You can add any live auctions on the site to
                  your Watchlist. This helps you stay on top of all the upcoming and ongoing action.

                  centralized location. Go ahead, sign in and start adding stuff to

                      </tr>
                    </tbody>
                  </table>
                </div>
                <ul id='l-nav'>
                  <li>
                    When bidding either manually or with BidMate, your Real Bids will be used first,
                    starting from the oldest to the newest Real Bids bought. If you run out of Real
                    Bids, your Token Bids will be used, from oldest to newest, so long as the
                    auction item is not classified as a Big Ticket item.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Token bids expire 60 days after you acquire them. Token Bids cannot be used to
                    bid on Big Ticket Auctions. This means if you want to bid on an iPhone, car, or
                    any items over N100,000 you’ll only be able to do so using your Real Bids.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When you’re bidding on an item that requires Real Bids, you don’t have to do
                    anything – the system knows to use your Real Bids. If you don’t have any Real
                    Bids, you will be alerted to go and purchase some before you can continue
                    bidding.

                <p>Our Big Ticket Items</p>
                <p>
                  As you may have noticed, we have lots of valuable deals for you to win on
                  Kobobid.com. We call some of them ‘Big Ticket Items’. These are items valued at
                  N100, 000 or more in actual retail/monetary value. Because of their nature, we
                  have some special notes attached to them:
                </p>
                <ul id='l-nav'>
                  <li>
                    All Big Ticket Items are restricted to the use of REAL BIDS ONLY. Token Bids are
                    not valid for auctions carrying the Big Ticket Item icon.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Some Big Ticket Items may have a different set of bidding rules. For instance,
                    on an iPhone 12, the auction will indicate that it’s “2x/3x/4x”. 2x means you
                    will need to use <strong>two</strong> bids (valued at N200 total) to register a
                    single bid on the auction. Meaning, each bid for the iPhone costs N200 each time
                    the price goes up by one unit (1Kobo).

                <p>
                  We’re sure you wouldn’t want to waste any second to claim your item after you win
                  an auction. But, just in case you get too carried away:
                </p>
                <ul id='l-nav'>
                  <li>
                    After winning your auction, you will have 48hrs to pay the final Auction Price +
                    Shipping &amp; Handling (where applicable). If you fail to redeem your winnings
                    within this time, the item won will automatically go to the next bidder (runner
                    up) from that auction to claim.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  You wouldn’t like that, would you? Us too. You’ve come this far, and so you get
                  multiple reminders from us via call, email or text to redeem your price. To this
                  end, make sure your notifications are on.
